# hello-world
My first repository! Just to try it out and learn the basics.

Hello World!
So yeah, I've got some spare time and I'd like to work on projects with different people, so that's why I made myself a Github account!
In the future I want to learn how to program (I already know some basics).
With the help of Github I'll be able to work on projects and to ask friends for help or improvements!

Thanks for your attention and see you soon!
